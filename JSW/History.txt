 History:

  1.0.0: First release.

  1.0.1: - Fixed pause mode: did not *pause* tune when
           enabled.
         - Fall counter initialization on a particular
           situation (only affects sound FX).
         - Max. fall counter adjustment on 'bottom'
         - Exit (falling): affects max. fall.

  1.0.2: - Max. fall counter adjustment on 'bottom'
         - Exit (falling): affects max. fall (16px more!)

  1.0.3: - Jumping from rope: couldn't jump verticaly.
           Jump has to face right/left.
         - Exit (falling): affects max. fall (16px more!)

  1.0.4: - First *frame* after *died* checks for arrows,
           guardians, etc. (see check label in DoWilly())
         - Fixed Willy's movement keys control
         - Fixed interframe just-landing/start-walking

  1.0.5: - Sorry if someone has tried to finish this!
           There is a bug in original game which has not
           been fixed here: data exported was from
           *unfixed* version.
           The bug is related to an unreachable (and
           invisible) item located at 'First Landing'
           room; the fix relocates it at 'The Hall'
           but it still remains not visible.
           I realized this trying to finish the game
           (cheating, obviously).

  1.0.6: - Fixed checking for scalator (added checking
           for conveyor in both checks for slope, too).

  1.0.7: - Fixed guardian checking in room 29: dib used for
           pixel collision was Willy's one, not 'pig' one.

  1.1.0: - Full screen support
         - FPS info

  1.2.0: - Improved green & B&W palettes
