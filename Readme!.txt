 MANIC MINER + JET SET WILLY
 ===========================


 Advice
 ------

   Pretty good remakes of the original ZX Spectrum ones:

     MANIC MINER   by Matthew Smith - Bug-Byte Ltd ©1983
     JET SET WILLY by Matthew Smith - Software Projects Ltd ©1984

 Notes
 -----

   Room data, sprites, tunes, ... were extracted from the original
   ZX tap files (Bug-Byte for Manic Miner, and Software Projects for 
   Jet Set Willy). Data file names correspond to the original memory 
   data offsets.


   Don't try to export related binary data from other versions: they 
   will not 'fit' this engine accurately.

   For both games, there are some special keys:
   
   [F1]:  show/hide fps (testing purposes)

   [F8]:  toggle windowed/full-screen

   [F11]: enable/disable TV monitor (scanlines)
   [F12]: toggle color / green and black and white monitor emulation	

   [+] (numpad): speed up fps (max 2x)
   [-] (numpad): speed down fps (min 1x)
   [x] (numpad): toggle maximum / normal speed
	
   Have fun!
